NAME
    simple_shell - a simple interactive shell program

SYNOPSIS
	./hsh

DESCRIPTION
    simple_shell is a simple shell program written in C. It provides both interactive and non-interactive modes for executing commands. In interactive mode, it displays a prompt and reads commands from the user until the user enters "exit" to quit the shell. In non-interactive mode, it takes a single command as an argument and executes it.

COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS
    command
        A command to be executed in non-interactive mode. If provided, myshell will execute this command and exit. The command can contain multiple arguments separated by spaces.

INTERACTIVE MODE
    When myshell is run without any command-line arguments, it enters interactive mode. In this mode, it displays a prompt ('$') and waits for the user to enter a command. The following built-in commands are supported:
    
    cd [directory]
        Change the current working directory to the specified directory.
    
    exit
        Exit the shell.

NON-INTERACTIVE MODE
    When myshell is run with a command-line argument, it enters non-interactive mode. In this mode, it executes the provided command and exits. The command can contain multiple arguments separated by spaces.
